These query definitions are means of gathering specific subsets of data from 
OpenStreetMap using the 
[Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL). 

One is used to gather highway data and a separate one for data whch is not used 
for routing but which may provide cartographic context. 

I've been using several bounding boxes for testing queries:

````
toronto plus a bit: 43.5,-80,44,-79
parkdale:           43.64,-79.44,43.65,-79.43
full GTHA:          42.8,-80.8,45.0,-77.9
